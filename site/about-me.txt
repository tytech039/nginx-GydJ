Hey, I'm Ty Wilson. I'm an cis asexual male, and decided to create this site to make the Suicide Hotline be even more linkable.

I've decided, right here and right now, that no one else should not have access to this resource. I'm going to do everything in my power to make this more known.

If you're reading this right now, and are considering taking your own life, call 988 now. Please. Please. PLEASE. FOR MY SAKE. PLEASE!

If the site is having technical problems, contact me at support@yanaw.us

BTW, it stands for You Are Not Alone With Us.
